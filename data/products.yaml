           USGS coastal change hazards research produces data, knowledge, and tools about storms, shoreline change, and
           sea-level rise. These information products are available at the <em><a href="http://marine.usgs.gov/coastalchangehazardsportal/"
           target="_blank"> coastal change hazards web portal</a></em>. The portal can be used to increase awareness
           and provide a basis for decision making.

    statement: >
              Recognizing the need for integrated soil moisture data, the President’s Climate Action Plan called for 
              the creation of a coordinated national soil moisture network. In response, a team led by NOAA’s 
              National Integrated Drought Information System completed a proof-of-concept pilot project. The 
              <em><a href="http://cida.usgs.gov/nsmn_pilot/" target="_blank">NSMN Pilot</a></em>, developed 
              collaboratively by Texas A&M and the U.S. Geological Survey, focuses on providing real-time in situ 
              soil moisture data, aggregated from a number of state and federal sources, to feed a map-based 
              visualization and a standard web service. The pilot was developed in order to meet the following 
              use cases: operational drought monitoring, experimental land surface modeling, and operational 
              hydrological modeling. The result of this pilot is a reference architecture that will inform the 
              implementation of an operational national soil moisture network.

              The Environmental Data Discovery and Transformation (EnDDaT) Tool is a system you can use to discover
              data from our natural environment. This tool accesses data from a variety of data sources, compiles and
              processes the data, and performs common transformations. The result is that environmental data from multiple
              sources is sorted into a single table that aids model development and similar tasks. See the user guide for
              step-by-step instructions on obtaining data, specifying transforms, and processing data.

              This is the public web interface to the USGS National Water Information System.  It provides access to water-resources
              data collected at approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
              Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  It has been nationally operational since 2001 and
              is the third most popular website in the U.S. Department of the Interior.
              Data served here also are available in open-standard formats at <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/">https://waterservices.usgs.gov/</a>.  These formats encourage
              easy interchange of water data and greater use of them in software applications.
